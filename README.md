# Automated Hardware Validation System

## Overview
The **Automated Hardware Validation System** is a software solution designed to automate the testing and validation of hardware performance under various environmental conditions such as temperature and voltage. It collects, analyzes, and visualizes hardware test data, integrates debugging tools, and commits the results to a Git repository for version control. 

### Features
- **Data Collection**: Collects simulated data based on hardware conditions such as temperature and voltage.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes test data using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to compute key metrics like the mean and standard deviation of the results.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the test results using **Matplotlib** to create graphs that display performance under different conditions.
- **Debugging**: Integrates **JTAG tools** for debugging hardware.
- **Version Control**: Automatically commits test results to a **Git repository** for traceability.

## Requirements

### Software Prerequisites
The following software and libraries are required to run this system:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed on your system. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Pandas**: For data analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the test data.

To install the necessary Python libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### JTAG Tool Integration
This system includes a placeholder for JTAG tool integration. To fully utilize the debugging feature, replace the simulated jtag_debug() function with actual JTAG tool invocations that match your specific hardware setup.

### Installation
Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-hardware-validation.git
cd automated-hardware-validation
### Install Dependencies

## Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Git Setup

Ensure your Git environment is set up and that you have access to a repository where results will be committed.

### JTAG Tool Setup

For hardware debugging, replace the jtag_debug() function in main.py with the actual command to invoke your JTAG debugging tool. Make sure to configure your environment to interface with your hardware through JTAG.

### Usage
Running the System
To run the Automated Hardware Validation System, execute the main.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Process Flow
The script performs the following steps:

Data Collection: Simulates the collection of test data under various conditions such as temperature and voltage.
Data Analysis: Uses Pandas and NumPy to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the results.
Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to plot a graph showing the hardware's performance under different conditions.
JTAG Debugging: Simulates a JTAG tool integration for hardware debugging. This step needs to be customized based on the actual hardware tools you are using.
Git Commit: Automatically commits the results to a Git repository to track changes and maintain version control of the test data.
Example Output
CSV Test Results: The test results will be saved to a file named hardware_test_results.csv. The file will contain the following columns:

Temperature: The test temperature in Celsius.
Voltage: The test voltage in Volts.
Mean: The average result from the test.
Std Dev: The standard deviation of the results.
Visualization: A plot will be displayed showing the performance data (mean test result) with respect to temperature for different voltages.

Git Version Control: The test results will be automatically committed to a Git repository. The following Git commands will be executed:

git add hardware_test_results.csv
git commit -m "Automated hardware validation results"
git push (ensure that your repository is set up for pushing)
Example Output
Test Results CSV Example:

Temperature	Voltage	Mean	Std Dev
25	3.3	1.45	0.03
50	5.0	2.10	0.04
75	7.0	3.20	0.05
Visualization Example: A graph showing the performance of the hardware across different temperatures and voltages.
